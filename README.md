# Parasoft Findings for TeamCity

The Parasoft Findings plugin enables you to visualize test results generated by the following Parasoft products in TeamCity:
* Parasoft SOAtest 9.x Report Parser

## Requirements

* TeamCity version 2017.1.2 or later.

## Installing the Parasoft Findings Plugin
1. Copy the zip plugin package into the <TeamCity Data Directory>/plugins directory.
2. Restart the TeamCity server.

See TeamCity Installing Additional Plugins documentation page for additional information.

## Configuring the Plug-in

1. In the build configuration page, choose Build Steps and click Add a build step. 
2. Choose “Parasoft Findings” from the Runner type drop-down menu.
3. Specify a name for the step (optional) and choose an execution step policy form the Execute step drop-down menu (see the [TeamCity documentation](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD10/Configuring+Build+Steps) for details).
4. Review the **Report location pattern** field. The Ant style file selection pattern in this script controls what SOAtest report files to include in the TeamCity build report.
5. Click **Save** when finished.
 
## Running the Build

A typical build configuration would consist of the following steps:
1. Clean the build checkout directory (optional). In this step you will clean the SOAtest XML report files left over from the previous build runs. You have the following options:
    - Configure a Command Line runner to clean the SOAtest XML report files left over from the previous runs. For instance, to remove all XML files from the build Checkout Directory run the following command: rm %system.teamcity.build.checkoutDir%/*.xml
    - Configure the build agent to delete the build Checkout Directory after the completion of the build. To do so, add the following line to the buildAgent.properties flile: teamcity.agent.build.checkoutDir.expireHours=0.See the following TeamCity documentation for more details: [Automatic Checkout Directory Cleaning](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD10/Build+Checkout+Directory#BuildCheckoutDirectory-AutomaticCheckoutDirectoryCleaning).
2. Run SOAtest. This step will generate SOAtest report files in XML format. The SOAtest XML report files must be saved in the TeamCity build project Checkout Directory.
3. Run the Parasoft Findings plugin. You can have multiple SOAtest runs that would generate multiple SOAtest XML report files prior to invoking this build step. If the build steps prior to the Parasoft Findings plugin build step generate multiple XML report files all test results from all these files will be added to the TeamCity build results.

## Viewing Results of the Last Build

Open the TeamCity build configuration page and click on the last build results link in the Overview or History tab. The build results pages contain the SOAtest report details:
The build results page in the **Overview** tab provides the success and error count, as well as error details:

The build results shown from in the **Tests** tab will contain the list of all SOAtest tests that ran in the build.

The **Build Log** tab contains logging information in case debugging is needed.


## Viewing Statistics and Trends

Click the **Statistics** tab of the build configuration page to see charts of the SOAtest reports historical data.

To view historical details of a particular SOAtest test, click the menu icon next to the test you are interested in and choose Test History. A page with detailed test history will open.
