# Parasoft Findings for TeamCity

The Parasoft Findings plugin is designed to be used in a post test-execution build step that integrates static analysis, functional and unit test reports generated by Parasoft tools into your Team City project. The task will collect static analysis and test results from the Parasoft report XML files.
- For test results, the number of passed/failed tests and result details will be displayed. Trending data in a graph for a simple visualization is also available.
- For static analysis results, details can be conveniently viewed as code inspection and duplicates results. Navigation to rule documentation is also available.
